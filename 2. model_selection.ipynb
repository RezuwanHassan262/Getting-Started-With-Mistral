      "To solve the problem of finding two indices in an array such that the corresponding elements add up to a given target, we can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the potential complements of each number. This approach allows us to solve the problem in linear time, \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient.\n",

      "1. Create an empty dictionary to store the numbers and their indices as we iterate through the array.\n",

      "   - If it is not, store the current number and its index in the dictionary.\n",
      "5. If the loop completes without finding a solution, return an appropriate message (though the problem guarantees a solution).\n",

      "\n",
      "print(\"All test cases pass\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation of the code:\n",
      "- We use a dictionary `num_to_index` to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far and their corresponding indices.\n",
      "- For each number in the array, we calculate its complement (`target - num`).\n",
      "- We check if this complement exists in the dictionary. If it does, we return the current index and the index of the complement.\n",
      "- If the complement does not exist in the dictionary, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary.\n",
      "- The solution is guaranteed to exist, so we do not need to handle the case where no solution is found.\n",
