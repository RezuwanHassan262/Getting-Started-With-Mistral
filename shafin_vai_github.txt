 I hold a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from RUET and have always been passionate about engineering and technology. In 2015, I founded Team Crack Platoon, an international automotive team that became the first in Bangladesh to design and build both a Formula Student car in the fuel category and a Formula Student car in the electric category. This was an exciting journey that fueled my love for innovation and problem-solving.

ðŸš— After my experience in motorsport engineering, I shifted my focus to the rapidly evolving field of AI in late 2020. I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s thesis on Meta-learning at Brac University, diving deep into the world of machine learning and its applications.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m always eager to learn and collaborate on cutting-edge projects that blend engineering with AI. Feel free to explore my repositories, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or just discussing the latest trends in tech!
